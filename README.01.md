# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple text-based version of the classic word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game picks a word from a predefined list.
- **Progressive Hangman Drawing**: As the player makes incorrect guesses, a hangman figure is drawn progressively.
- **Simple Command Line Interface**: No graphics, just text-based interaction.

## How to Play

1. The game selects a random word.
2. You guess one letter at a time.
3. If your guess is correct, the letter is revealed in the word.
4. If your guess is wrong, a part of the hangman is drawn.
5. You win by guessing the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.
6. You lose if the hangman is fully drawn (after 6 incorrect guesses).
